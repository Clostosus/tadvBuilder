# tadvBuilder
Text adventure builder and player. 

The [Builder](https://github.com/Clostosus/tadvBuilder/blob/main/dist/storyBuilder.html) is available as one locally executable File.  
You can use the User Interface there to create an interactive story and then copy or export it as a File in human readable `.json` format. 

Use this [ViewerTemplate](https://github.com/Clostosus/tadvBuilder/blob/main/src/storyViewer.html) to integrate an interactive story into your own Website.
